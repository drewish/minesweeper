# Minesweeper

After seeing [this demo](http://ahrengot.com/tutorials/greensock-javascript-animation/) I wanted an excuse to play with Greensock's tweening libraries. So when I came across a company that wanted you to build Minesweeper with HTML/JavaScript as a coding sample it seemed like a perfect fit.

So, here's my—somewhat simplified—take on Minesweeper. It doesn't let you flag mines but it's got one feature you won't find in Microsoft's version: a cheat button. 

It also supports a few board sizes but I haven't come up with a UI that I like for exposing it. You can give them a try:
