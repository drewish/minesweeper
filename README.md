# Minesweeper

After seeing [this demo](http://ahrengot.com/tutorials/greensock-javascript-animation/) I wanted an excuse to play with Greensock's tweening libraries. So when I came across a company that wanted you to build Minesweeper in HTML and JavaScript it seemed like a perfect fit.

So, here's my simplified take on Minesweeper. 

It supports a few board sizes but I haven't come up with a UI that I like for exposing it. You can give them a try:

- http://drewish.github.com/minesweeper#large

Oh, I'm sure you'll notice it's got one feature you won't find in Microsoft's version: a cheat button.
