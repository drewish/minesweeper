# Minesweeper

This started out as a coding sample for a job interview. I'd used Greensock's
JavaScript tweening library for the animations. Recently I'd been looking for
a project to do more with CSS transitions and animations so I dusted this
off.

So, here's my—somewhat simplified—take on Minesweeper. It doesn't let you
flag mines but it's got one feature you won't find in Microsoft's version:
a cheat button. 

It also supports a few board sizes but I haven't come up with a UI that I like
for exposing it. You can give them a try:
